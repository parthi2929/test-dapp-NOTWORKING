# test-dapp-WORKING

**Update: 19th Dec 2017**  
test dapp fixed using zeroclient and ethjs signer scripts.


**Old issue when it was not working:**  
Please check index.html which uses web3 api. With injected api, it works (chrome with metamask). localhost (ganache-cli) also works.     

Infura works till getting account details. But not for setter and watching events. Showing Invalid JSON response.   

Why? and what could be the solution for this? Kindly help.  

Coursetro.sol is the deployed contract using remix with injected web3 provider (metamask).
