# test-dapp-NOTWORKING
Please check index.html which uses web3 api. With injected api, it works (chrome with metamask). localhost (ganache-cli) also works.   
Infura works till getting account details. But not for setter and watching events. Showing Invalid JSON response. 

Why? and what could be the solution for this? Kindly help.
